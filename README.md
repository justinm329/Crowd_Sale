# Crowd_Sale

* In this project I created an ERC20 token and minted it through the crowdsale. The main contract is in Crowdsale.sol and allows users to send eth and in return they will recieve PupperCoin. The contract mints the tokens and automatically distributes them to the buyers in one transaction.
